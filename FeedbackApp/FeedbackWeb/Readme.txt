Implement an application that manages courses, teachers and feedbacks for the courses
the application will have 2 sections: administration and user facing.
- An administrator will be able to manage courses and teachers(Create, read, update, delete)
- and administrator will be able to see feedbacks for each course
- each teacher will teach only on course
- an user will be able to see the courses and provide feedback for each course.
you need to:
- create your domain entities with what you see fit for your application in terms of tables and columns.
it is your choice how you do this. You can create the database first, and then scafold the entities, or use the code-first approach.
- create and style your application layout
- create controllers, views, models, and have the right validations.
- use partial views where is needed
- don't use the domain objects directly, use models
- use repository pattern, and interfaces
- add tests for at least one controller (edited)
